Codestarter installer for Ubuntu on Chromebooks
===============================================

This script will install everything necessary to transform an Acer C720 into a
Codestarter laptop. Primarily this involves partitioning the built-in SSD and
installing Ubuntu along with various patches and Codestarter customizations.

Upon completion, you will be able to boot into both ChromeOS (CTRL-D) or Ubuntu
(CTRL-L) from the developer mode boot screen.

For more back story on why we chose the Acer C720 and some of the Codestarter
customizations, see our blog post at http://bit.ly/X24d9r.
